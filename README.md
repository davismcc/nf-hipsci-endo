### Introduction
davismcc/nf-hipsci-endo: Process data for HipSci single-cell endoderm project.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker / singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.
